# SMT-BMC-Project
this repository contains the finaL code for the masters project I worked on in 2021. It explores Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) 
and Bounded Model checking (BMC) within a planning domain. PDDL+ was chosen as the planning architecture of this project, although
as demonstrations of SMT and BMC, some smaller pieces of code were worked through in python.

Domain.pddl contains the domain file for the final part of the project, and the additional PDDL files are instances used to experiment with, 
namely impossible tasks and experimenting with bounds within planning
